# Data Cleaning
I am learning Data analytics concepts. I am so excited about working with data. I am uploading my learning in the form of short projects in GitHub. 

I performed a simple data-cleaning operation on the sample data. The sample data consists of 15 rows of data with 9 columns. Some of columns has no values. So empty cells were replace with 'unknown' values in few cases 
and mean of the column in certain case(especially Age)
